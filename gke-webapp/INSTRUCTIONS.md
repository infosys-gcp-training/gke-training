# GKE Training Module
## Activity 06 - Webapp
### Part 1

## Activity Objective
The purpose of this activity is to use what we know to deploy a custom web app. By the time you are finished with this activity, you will have implemented a practical example with Kubernetes & GKE.

## Create a cluster
If you haven't already, just refer here.

Once connected, you use the **kubectl** command to list, view, create, update, delete resources
> These are **imperative** commands.

## Using kubectl commands

Let's check that we are connected.
#### View nodes
```
$ kubectl get nodes
```
